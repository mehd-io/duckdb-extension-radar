# DuckDB Extensions Radar

This repo contains information about DuckDB extensions found on GitHub. Refreshed daily. Sorted by Created date. 
 Last refresh **2025-09-30**.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is a bit hacky and searches for repos containing the string `.duckdb_extension`, so it's not 100% reliable.
Extensions that are not included in the DuckDB core (and are not listed in the output from duckdb_extensions()) are considered unsigned. To install these extensions, you must use the `-unsigned` flag when launching DuckDB. Please be aware that installing unsigned extensions carries potential risks, as this repository does not endorse or guarantee the trustworthiness of any listed extensions.
